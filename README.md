# pv-addon-discs

Paper only [Plasmo Voice](https://github.com/plasmoapp/plasmo-voice) addon. Play audio from Youtube and other sources in Minecraft using music discs. Inspired by [SVC](https://github.com/henkelmax/simple-voice-chat)'s [AudioPlayer](https://github.com/henkelmax/audio-player) & [CustomDiscs](https://github.com/Navoei/CustomDiscs).

The addon can stream audio from various sources instead of saving audio files on the server. It even supports Youtube and Twitch live streams. Thanks to the brilliant [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer) library.
